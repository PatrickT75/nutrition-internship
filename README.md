**Project 1: Kombucha**

Shannon index (alpha diversity) of different kombucha products.

Used ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc test to determine significant differences between products.

**Project 2: Grape Intervention**

Assess changes in the microbiome in control vs intervention subjects.

Used PCA to cluster subjects and compare with true grouping.

Created a correlation heatmap between bile acid and microbiome counts.

DeSeq2 used to identify species of bacteria that are elevated/lowered after intervention.

Created a script to extract pathway descriptions from GO/KEGG pathway identifiers.
